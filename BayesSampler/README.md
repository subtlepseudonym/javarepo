# Gibbs and Rejection Sampling
This project contains two main methods, one in GibbsSampler and one in RejectionSampler.
Both methods require 3 command line arguments:
java Sampler data.json query.json numIterations
The first argument is the data to be sampled in JSON format.
The second argument is the query in JSON format.
The third argument is the number of iterations to run before querying (not including burn in).

A sample data file and query file are included in the repo.
